        "Congratulations, Facility Manager. You have turned two humans into three. Surely your old professors at the Gargelmax Xenoagriculture School will be pleased with your ingenuity.",
        "As your human population grows, build more facilities for transforming their biomass into useful industrial exports. Human raw ingredients can be used in food, entertainment, building materials, and industrial solvents.",
        "Your humans are now numerous. But the more numerous they become, the more of them seem to become rude..."
    ],
    facility_created: [
        "You have built your first Reproduction Chamber. Humans will enter this completely sealed, windowless cube. Some will emerge with additional humans, but the process has a high fail rate.",
        "You have built your first Isolation Chamber. Your xenobiology professors believed that humans might become better trained if kept in sensory deprivation environments. Time to test that theory!",
        "You have built your first Epicurean Hall. This facility will process human biomatter into approved, sanitary foodstuffs. Enjoy your first taste of these high-quality ingredients!"
    ],
    rude_human: [
        "One of your humans has become rude and rebellious. They are using their opposable thumbs and oppositional attitude to scurry about the facility, causing problems and defacing facility property. Deal with them immediately!",
        "The number of rude, rebellious humans infesting your facility has grown. Your superiors are displeased.",
        "Humans are so small that it is difficult to even grasp them with your grabber-limb. As a result, they evade most conventional efforts to control them.",
        "You have so many rude humans in your facility that they have created their own society in the rafters. They evade glue traps with ease and rain small pellets of waste down on your facility operators.",
        "The rude humans remain a stain on your reputation. At department meetings, the other Factory Managers whisper about your poor performance.",
        "Sometimes you think that the rude humans are making each other more rude. They are whispering, but their voices are too small and high-pitched for you to understand what they are saying.",
        "The rude humans are painting tiny pictures of you - of YOU! - on the walls. Very close to the floor. You have to bend down to see them.",
        "You were sleeping last night and a rude human crawled inside your ear and stabbed you with a small \"knife\" made out of a flake of aluminum. The facility must ban canned beverages!",
        "There seems to be nothing you can to do control the behavior of rude humans. They are constantly climbing your lower limbs and gouging your skin with weapons. Mostly, you no longer feel safe to enter the facility.",
        "Your doctor says that you need to take time off to recover from \"burnout.\" You are too worried to take time off because you are afraid that the humans will ruin everything while you are gone.",
        "Humans have claimed their first Gargelmaxian victim. They climbed into one of your staffers' airways and cut them up from the inside. It's too gruesome to think about!",
        "Gargelmaxians entering the facility now wear impermeable airway masks, to prevent small humans from climbing inside them and butchering them from the inside out.",
        "The humans have begun slipping sharp objects inside the shoes of any Gargelmaxian who enters the facility. Full body hazmat attire may be necesarry.",
        "One of your staff slipped and fell on the factory floor today. The humans had greased the walkway with a very thin layer of industrial lubricant. As he lay there, they stabbed him in the eye!",
        "The humans have begun unscrewing the bolts of the machines. Chairs fall apart when you sit in them, too. Nobody can catch them in the act",
        "You have begun to dream about humans hollowing out your internal organs and living inside you. Making saunas out of your several stomachs. Feasting on your gizzard-stones.",
        "You find a human inside your shirt when you leave the facility. You try to squash it like a bug, but it leaps away. Something wicked glints in its hand.",
        "Gargelmaxian government is taking particular interest in your humans. They are investigating to see if a mass release of humans in a war zone could function as a kind of bioweapon.",
        "You still haven't found that human who hitchhiked into your home. You laid glue traps and caught nothing. Where did they go?!",
        "The floor of the facility has become unstable, pitted, and rotten. Rude humans must be hiding beneath it, destabilizing the joists!",
        "There are now several loose humans hiding in your house. You call an exterminator. They vaccuum everything.",
        "You have not been able to confirm that the humans hiding inside your house were killed. You begin to look for a new home.",
        "The rude humans are singing songs and chants. There are so many, they shake the facility walls. What are they saying? You do not know!",
        "Your home burns down in the middle of the night.",
        "You find a room in a hotel. You can hear pests crawling in the walls. Are they humans? You request a room change.",
        "You put a hat on and it explodes. It leaves a shallow but painful wound on the top of your head. The bomb squad says that tiny explosives were sewn into the lining.",
        "Your manager gives you a terrible performance review.",
        "The machinery in the facility has been running terribly. The mechanic opens a panel on the side of a battery and rude humans spill out! They stud his face and eyes with tiny poisoned bolts!",
        "You are placed on a performance improvement plan. Rude human numbers must fall to zero before your PIP completes.",
        "Rude humans are marching drills on the facility fairground. (They have built a fairground.)",
        "Your full-body hazmat suits all have holes in them now. Rude humans must have found their way into the locker.",
        "You found a worrying lump beneath your skin. You make an appointment with the doctor.",
        "It seems that the more rude humans you have, the ruder humans become in general.",
        "The doctor is unable to identify the lump beneath your skin. They schedule you for a biopsy.",
        "You have been dreaming about rude humans every night. In your dreams they carve you up with tiny knives.",
        "One of your staffers trips and falls on the factory floor. Rude humans leap out from the shadows and swarm on his face, ripping the hazmat suit. They stab him in the eye. He's in the hospital now.",
        "The GFDA will be auditing your factory soon. They're concerned about a rude human containment breach.",
        "The biopsy is scheudled for next week. The lump under your skin is still there.",
        "Your staffers are quitting in droves. Too many have been injured by the blades and arrows of the rude humans.",
        "Your PIP will be completing soon. Your boss still expects you to end the entire phenomenon of rude humans.",
        "You go in for the biopsy. The doctor begins to slice open your lump.",
        "It is a hard, plasticky pellet. The doctor lifts it from a pit beneath your skin."

    ending_events: [
        "The pellet cracks open. Rude humans spill out!",
        "They're fighting! They're gouging your skin! They have small explosives! They have long knives!",
        "Your surgeon flees the room, screaming! The rude humans have clogged his gills!",
        "The rude humans are flaying your eyelids! They're carving your cheeks! You swat them, but they dodge your vast, meaty graspers!",
        "A rude human is crawling beneath your skin, swimming up your vein!",
        "Your surgeon falls with a thump on the operating room floor - the rude humans set off a homemade bomb in his jaw!",
        "You stagger out of the operating room. Blind, you grasp a fire extinguisher and turn it on yourself. Rude humans fly everywhere.",
        "You make it to your vehicle. Rude humans drop off you, frozen and suffocated.",
        "Careening from side to side of the road, you arrive at the factory. The airlock is open. Gargelmaxians are fleeing the building. Masses of rude humans seethe on their skin.",
        "You run through the parking lot, screaming. Flames dance on the roof of the factory farm. Rivers of miniscrule humans flow across the concrete.",
        "Something bursts in your lower gizzard.",
        "You fall to your knees. A pain like burning spreads through your insides. Up your gullet.",
        "Little shrill voices scream from within you.",
        "Your jaw disdends. Rude humans spill out like water.",
        "You're bleeding. Too many wounds to count. Your organs are separating.",
        "From where you lie on the concrete, you can see rude humans marching into the forest beyond, waving their tiny banners.",
        "A group of marching humans separates from the crowd. They turn toward your eye.",
        "They have long, long knives in their tiny little hands."
